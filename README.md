## Simple Chatty Bot (Java)
A simple bot that will help you in your learning and make it more fun.
https://hyperskill.org/projects/31

**Stage #1 Hello! What’s your name?**
Teach your assistant to introduce itself in the console

**Stage #2: How old are you?**
Use your knowledge of strings and numbers to make the assistant guess your age

**Stage #3: Let’s count!**
Your assistant is old enough to learn how to count. And you are experienced enough to apply the for-loop at this stage!

**Stage #4: The student and the teacher**
At this point, the assistant will be able to check your knowledge and ask multiple choice questions. 
Add some methods to your code and make the stage even better

## Coffee Machine (Java)
Write the software for a simulation of a real-world coffee machine.

**Stage #1 Hello, coffee!**
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

**Stage #2 Machines have needs**
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

**Stage #3 Enough coffee for everyone**
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

**Stage #4 Action!**
Upgrade your knowledge of methods - set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

**Stage #5 On a coffee loop**
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you press exit.

**Stage #6 Brush your code**
Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.

## Encryption-Decryption (Java)
Developing a command line application which can encrypt/decrypt strings using various encryption algorithms.

**Stage #1 Encrypted**
Learn to input the data and encrypt it, replacing the letters.

**Stage #2 Knowledge is key**
Learn to encrypt messages with a numeric key, using the Caesar cypher. 

**Stage #3 Decrypted!**
Encrypting a message is only half of the deal: now learn to decrypt it as well, using a standard Unicode table.

**Stage #4 I Command you**
Practice working with the command line, using it for passing the mode, the key and the string.

**Stage #5 X-files**
Work with files; learn to store your data in a file.

**Stage #6 Choices, Choices**
Add the possibility to choose a specific encryption algorithm: Ceasar or Unicode.
